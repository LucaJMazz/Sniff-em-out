#🕵️‍♂️ Sniff ’em Out

A pass-and-play social deduction mobile game where a group of players try to figure out who the odd one out is — before it’s too late.

Good luck lying to your friends.

🧩 How the Game Works

Sniff ’em Out is built around conversation and deception.

Most players receive the same topic.
One player receives a different or missing topic.
Players take turns asking questions, answering carefully, and trying not to expose themselves — while attempting to sniff out the impostor.
